#operator->it is a symbol which is used to perform operation between operands
#arithmetic operation
# a=2
# b=3
# c=a+b#c,a,b are the operand and =+ are operator

# print(c)

# print(a-b)
# print(a*b)
# print(a/b)#it gives in float ans so the no any value loss in that case
# print(a//b)#floor divivson it clear all the number after decimal
# print(a**b)#it makes power a to the power b
# print(b%a)#it gives the remainder 



#comparision/relative /conditional operator->boolean result:-=,!=,<,>,<=,>=

# a=7;
# b=8;

# print(a==b);
# print(a!=b);
# print(a>=b)
# print(a<=b)

#assignment operator

# a=20;
# a=a+1;
# a+=1
# print(a)

#logical operator:AND OR NOT
# a=20;
# b=3;
# print(a+b)#it gives the answer 21 i.e true contain the 1  internally

# print(True and False)
# print(True or False)
# print(not True)
# print(a<40 and b>50)

#membership operator: in and not in
# name="my name is ashish"
# print("my" in name)
# print("ashish" not in name)


#identity operator : is -- isnot:location
# a=8;#python use the same location for the equal data
# b=8;

# c=45;
# print(id(c))
# print(id(a))
# print(id(b))

# print(a is b )#it look the memory address of the data
# print(a==b)


#for the mutable data type vale are store in the different data type

# a=[1,2,3,6,7]
# b=[1,2,3]
# print(id(a))
# print(id(b))

# print(a==b)#it gives true
# print(a is b)#it gives the false because for the mutable data type same data can always store in the different memory loaction

#bitwise operation---it is used in the integerr data type and the convert it into the binary can calculate in each bit
# a=12#1100
# b=13#1101
# print(a & b)#ans gives 12
# print(a|b)#ans gives 13
